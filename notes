what to know about goblins
.
they like trinkets, it is their entire economy, a goblin with out a trinket is sad
goblins like building and riding mine carts thru their tunnels
goblens live under an anarcho-monoarchy
seven is the highest they can count and even then its iffy
goeblin maegic is performed via mixing potions created from mushrooms
accurate mail system despite poor pengobship, goblein mail deliverers can immediately recognize an address
they live in caves and forts ruled by kings
the king is the one with the hat
human knights are a goblins only enemy
goblins drink milk and honey
